### Hey! I'm [@rooflexx] (Lirim Shala) ðŸ‘‹



I'm a software engineer from Kosovo. ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡°


I have been building APIs and tools for E-Commerce & CRM and CMS in United States and Europe, with different teams and organizations. ðŸŒŽ


I like to build things with Django/FastAPI, SQL/NoSQL databases and Docker.


I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to my current full-time job. At the same time, I'm also trying to help the open-source community.
