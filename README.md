I'm a software engineer from Kosovo. ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡°


As a senior software engineer with over 5 years of experience in the industry, I have a strong foundation in computer science principles and a passion for developing high-quality, scalable, and maintainable software. My expertise lies in Python, and I have a track record of delivering successful projects in this language.

In my past & current role, I have led the development of several complex systems and have consistently demonstrated my ability to write clean, efficient code. I also have experience with agile development methodologies and have a proven track record of working effectively in a team environment.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator and thrive in collaborative environments. I am always looking to learn and grow, and am excited to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge and skills.
