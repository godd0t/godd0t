### Hi there, I'm Lir Shala, aka godd0t ðŸ™Œ

I'm a software engineer extraordinaire from the beautiful land of Kosovo ðŸ‡½ðŸ‡°. I have more than 5 years of experience in the tech industry, working on various projects that showcase my skills and creativity. I have a solid foundation in computer science and a passion for developing software that is high-quality, scalable, and maintainable.

Python is my weapon of choice, where I have mastered the art of writing clean, efficient, and robust code that adheres to the best practices and standards. I have built web applications, data analysis tools, and more using Python and its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. I'm also proficient in agile development methodologies and love working in dynamic, team-based environments.

But I'm not just a software engineer! I'm also a curious learner, an avid reader, and a friendly communicator. I value collaboration and innovation as the keys to success in any project. I'm always open to learning new things, taking on new challenges, and improving my technical skills.
